# Forecast-Tool

Starter monorepo with `client` (Vite + React + TS) and `server` (Node + Express + TS + Prisma + SQLite).

Philosophy: small files, clear layers, tests, and environment-driven configuration to ease later deployment on Linux/Hetzner.

See `docs/` for architecture and run instructions.
